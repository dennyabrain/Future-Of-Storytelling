#23/01/15 to 24/01/15

Me and Saki met to discuss possibilities. Later on all of us (Laura, Aditya and Elise) sat down and discussed where we were at.

We thought of the possible forms a story could take.

---------------------

+ Linear 
+ Linear with options but same end 

Aditya was excited about this too though we agreed that such a fatalist story 
where no matter what you do, you get the same end, seems to be repeated often in an interactive story telling
context.Understandably so.Given it would be easier to combine various elements in this form.
We decided to explore more before settling down.

+ Linear with options but different end

And I guess a mixture of the above two could work too.

+ Non-linear with options but same end

+ Non-linear with options but different end

--------------------- 

Some Computation to generate possible scenarios. We realized that it would be interesting to consider dummy characters and 
think of scenarios(which block a user selects and where they place it) to start getting an idea of how an idea plays out.
We started with considering 'Rabit', 'Lion','hole' and 'Poison' as our objects and 'hill', 'forest', 'water' and 'swamp'.
With some trivial permutations and combinations, it became clear that even with such limited number of objects, the number
of possible pathways and stories would blow up immediatly. A sample of the Results generated by my script is attached below.

I also realized that perhaps writing/conceptualizing an interactive story would require a tool for us to visualize and consider all 
possibilities. So I am going to keep a lookout for that. Anytime a tool can be made to make things easier and visualize a story
for everyone on the team, I will try to put up a hacky prototype. Even with the little time spent on it already, I see how
a custom software/technology itself will be a aid in creating the final product.

#Results for the Detective Story
objects selected were 'Detective', 'Murderer', 'Knife'

blocks/Settings selected were 'Mansion', 'Basement' ,'Bar'

###Assumptions made :
1) Order within each block does not affect the story itself. For instance (Detective, Murderer) or (Murderer, Detective) will mean the same thing

2) Allow only unique objects. For instance, user cannot put the same object (Murderer,Knife) on all the three blocks.

---------------------------------------------------------------

###Limitation/Learning : 

When you look at a case like 

(Murderer,Knife) (Detective,Murderer) (Detective,Knife)

or

(Murderer,Knife) (Detective,Knife) (Detective,Murderer)

As the user plays, how does the system know which story to play out when only the first block is set up. Do we ask the user to 
put all the objects and then begin the story? In that case it becomes non interactive after the first interaction.
